## Detail
If there are players in card effect, players with weakness, or players with damage down, they will be skipped.
If the melees that get the most out of The Balance each have the above effects, they will distribute the card to the ranges that does not have a Debuff.
Also, if all DPS have a Debuff, distribute cards to tanks and healers.
