## Detail
If there are players in card effect, players with weakness, or players with damage down, they will be skipped.
For example, when you draw The Balance, you will distribute cards to Melee.
However, Astro will hand out cards to the ranges when the melees have the above effect.
Also, if all DPS have a Debuff, distribute cards to tanks and healers.
