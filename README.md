## About
Astro realizes the system by forcibly intervening in the action cue system.

Therefore, the oGCD may be invalidated, but please forgive me.

### Detail
Players with a card effect, a weakness effect, or a damage down effect are skipped.

For example, if Melee has the above debuff, Astro distributes The Balance to Range.
